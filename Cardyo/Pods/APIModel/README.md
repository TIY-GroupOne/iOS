# ApiModel

Interact with REST apis using realm.io to represent objects. The goal of `ApiModel` is to be easy to setup, easy to grasp, and fun to use. Boilerplate should be kept to a minimum, and also intuitive to set up.

This project is very much inspired by [@idlefingers'](https://github.com/idlefingers) excellent [api-model](https://github.com/izettle/api-model).

## Getting started

Add `APIModel` to your `Podfile`, and run `pod install`:

```ruby
pod 'APIModel', '~> 0.10.0'
```

The key part is to implement the `ApiModel` protocol.

```swift
import RealmSwift
import ApiModel

class Post: Object, ApiModel {
    // Standard Realm boilerplate
    dynamic var id = ""
	dynamic var title = ""
	dynamic var contents = ""
	dynamic lazy var createdAt = NSDate()

	override class func primaryKey() -> String {
        return "id"
    }

    // Define the standard namespace this class usually resides in JSON responses
    // MUST BE singular ie `post` not `posts`
    class func apiNamespace() -> String {
        return "post"
    }

    // Define where and how to get these. Routes are assumed to use Rails style REST (index, show, update, destroy)
    class func apiRoutes() -> ApiRoutes {
        return ApiRoutes(
            index: "/posts.json",
            show: "/post/:id:.json"
        )
    }

    // Define how it is converted from JSON responses into Realm objects. A host of transforms are available
    // See section "Transforms" in README. They are super easy to create as well!
    class func fromJSONMapping() -> JSONMapping {
        return [
            "id": ApiIdTransform(),
            "title": StringTransform(),
            "contents": StringTransform(),
            "createdAt": NSDateTransform()
        ]
    }

    // Define how this object is to be serialized back into a server response format
    func JSONDictionary() -> [String:AnyObject] {
        return [
            "id": id,
            "title": email,
            "contents": contents,
            "created_at": createdAt
        ]
    }
}
```

## Configuring the API

To represent the API itself, you have to create an object of the `ApiManager` class. This holds a `ApiConfiguration` object defining the host URL for all requests. After it has been created it can be accessed from the `func apiManager() -> ApiManager` singleton function.

To set it up:

```
// Put this somewhere in your AppDelegate or together with other initialization code
var apiConfig = ApiConfig(host: "https://service.io/api/v1/")

ApiSingleton.setInstance(ApiManager(configuration: apiConfig))
```

If you would like to disable request logging, you can do so by setting `requestLogging` to `false`:

```swift
apiConfig.requestLogging = false
```

### Global and Model-local configurations

For the most part an API is consistent across endpoints, however in the real world, conventions usually differ wildly. The global configuration is the one set by calling `ApiSingleton.setInstance(ApiManager(configuration: apiConfig))`.

To have a model-local configuration a model needs to implement the `ApiConfigurable` protocol, which consists of a single method:

```swift
public protocol ApiConfigurable {
    static func apiConfig(config: ApiConfig) -> ApiConfig
}
```

Input is the root base configuration and output is the model's own config object. The object passed in is a copy of the root configuration, so you are free to modify that object without any side-effects.

```swift
static func apiConfig(config: ApiConfig) -> ApiConfig {
  config.encoding = ApiRequest.FormDataEncoding
  return config
}```

## Interacting with APIs

The base of `ApiModel` is the `Api` wrapper class. This class wraps an `Object` type and takes care of fetching objects, saving objects and dealing with validation errors.

### Basic REST verbs

`ApiModel` supports querying API's using basic HTTP verbs.

```swift
// GET call without parameters
Api<Post>.get("/v1/posts.json") { response in
    println("response.isSuccessful: \(response.isSuccessful)")
    println("Response as an array: \(response.array)")
    println("Response as a dictionary: \(response.dictionary)")
    println("Response errors?: \(response.errors)")
}

// Other supported methods:

Api<Post>.get(path, parameters: [String:AnyObject]) { response // ...
Api<Post>.post(path, parameters: [String:AnyObject]) { response // ...
Api<Post>.put(path, parameters: [String:AnyObject]) { response // ...
Api<Post>.delete(path, parameters: [String:AnyObject]) { response // ...

// no parameters

Api<Post>.get(path) { response // ...
Api<Post>.post(path) { response // ...
Api<Post>.put(path) { response // ...
Api<Post>.delete(path) { response // ...

// You can also pass in custom `ApiConfig` into each of the above mentioned methods:
Api<Post>.get(path, parameters: [String:AnyObject], apiConfig: ApiConfig) { response // ...
Api<Post>.post(path, parameters: [String:AnyObject], apiConfig: ApiConfig) { response // ...
Api<Post>.put(path, parameters: [String:AnyObject], apiConfig: ApiConfig) { response // ...
Api<Post>.delete(path, parameters: [String:AnyObject], apiConfig: ApiConfig) { response // ...
```

Most of the time you'll want to use the `ActiveRecord`-style verbs `index/show/create/update` for interacting with a REST API, as described below.

### Fetching objects

Using the `index` of a REST resource:

`GET /posts.json`
```swift
Api<Post>.findArray { posts in
    for post in posts {
        println("... \(post.title)")
    }
}
```

Using the `show` of a REST resource:

`GET /user.json`
```swift
Api<User>.find { userResponse in
    if let user = userResponse {
        println("User is: \(user.email)")
    } else {
        println("Error loading user")
    }
}
```

### Storing objects

```swift
var post = Post()
post.title = "Hello world - A prologue"
post.contents = "Hello!"
post.createdAt = NSDate()

var form = Api<Post>(model: post)
form.save { _ in
    if form.hasErrors {
        println("Could not save:")
        for error in form.errorMessages {
            println("... \(error)")
        }
    } else {
        println("Saved! Post #\(post.id)")
    }
}
```

`Api` will know that the object is not persisted, since it does not have an `id`  set (or which ever field is defined as `primaryKey` in Realm). So a `POST` request will be made as follows:

`POST /posts.json`
```json
{
    "post": {
        "title": "Hello world - A prologue",
        "contents": "Hello!",
        "created_at": "2015-03-08T14:19:31-01:00"
    }
}
```

If the response is successful, the attributes returned by the server will be updated on the model.

`200 OK`
```json
{
    "post": {
        "id": 1
    }
}
```

The errors are expected to be in the format:

`400 BAD REQUEST`
```json
{
    "post": {
        "errors": {
            "contents": [
                "must be longer than 140 characters"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

And this will make it possible to access the errors as follows:

```swift
form.errors["contents"] // -> [String]
// or
form.errorMessages // -> [String]
```

## Transforms

Transforms are used to convert attributes from JSON responses to rich types. The easiest way to explain is to show a simple transform.

`ApiModel` comes with a host of standard transforms. An example is the `IntTransform`:

```swift
class IntTransform: Transform {
    func perform(value: AnyObject?) -> AnyObject {
        if let asInt = value?.integerValue {
            return asInt
        } else {
            return 0
        }
    }
}
```

This takes an object and attempts to convert it into an integer. If that fails, it returns the default value 0.

Transforms can be quite complex, and even convert nested models. For example:

```swift
class User: Object, ApiModel {
    dynamic var id = ApiId()
    dynamic var email = ""
    let posts = List<Post>()

    static func fromJSONMapping() -> JSONMapping {
        return [
            "posts": ArrayTransform<Post>()
        ]
    }
}

Api<User>.find { response in
    let user = response!.model

    println("User: \(user.email)")
    for post in user.posts {
        println("\(post.title)")
    }
}
```

Default transforms are:

- StringTransform
- IntTransform
- FloatTransform
- DoubleTransform
- BoolTransform
- NSDateTransform
- ModelTransform
- ArrayTransform
- PercentageTransform

However, it is really easy to define your own. Go nuts!

## Hooks

`ApiModel` uses [Alamofire](https://github.com/alamofire/alamofire) for sending and receiving requests. To hook into this, the `API` class currently has `before`- and `after`-hooks that you can use to modify or log the requests. An example of sending user credentials with each request:

```swift
// Put this somewhere in your AppDelegate or together with other initialization code
api().beforeRequest { request in
    if let loginToken = User.loginToken() {
        request.parameters["access_token"] = loginToken
    }
}
```

There is also a `afterRequest` which passes in a `ApiRequest` and `ApiResponse`:

```swift
api().afterRequest { request, response in
    println("... Got: \(response.status)")
    println("... \(request)")
    println("... \(response)")
}
```

## URLs

Given the setup for the `Post` model above, if you wanted to get the full url with replacements for the show resource (like `https://service.io/api/v1/posts/123.json`), you can use:

```swift
post.apiUrlForRoute(Post.apiRoutes().show)
// NOT IMPLEMENTED YET BECAUSE LIMITATIONS IN SWIFT: post.apiUrlForResource(.Show)
```

## Dealing with IDs

As a consumer of an API, you never want to make assumptions about the ID structure used for their models. Do not use `Int` or anything similar for ID types, strings are to be recommended. Therefor `ApiModel` defines a typealias to `String`, called ApiId. There is also an `ApiIdTransform` available for IDs.

## Namespaces and envelopes

Some API's wrap all their responses in an "envelope", a container that is generic for all responses. For example an API might wrap all response data within a `data`-property of the root JSON:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "user": { ... }
    }
}
```

To deal with this gracefully there is a configuration option on the `ApiConfig` class called `rootNamespace`. This is a dot-separated path that is traversed for each response. To deal with the above example you would simply:

```swift
let config = ApiConfig()
config.rootNamespace = "data"
```

It can also be more complex, for example if the envelope looked something like this:

```json
{
    "JsonResponseEnvelope": {
        "SuccessFullJsonResponse": {
            "SoapResponseContainer": {
                "EnterpriseBeanData": {
                    "user": { ... }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This would then convert into the `rootNamespace`:

```swift
let config = ApiConfig()
config.rootNamespace = "JsonResponseEnvelope.SuccessFullJsonResponse.SoapResponseContainer.EnterpriseBeanData"
```

## Caching and storage

It is up to you to cache and store the results of any calls. ApiModel does not do that for you, and will not do that, since strategies vary wildly depending on needs.

## File uploads

Just as the `JSONDictionary` can return a dictionary of parameters to be sent to the server, it can also contain `NSData` values that can be uploaded to a server. For example you could convert `UIImage`s to `NSData` and upload them for profile images.

The standard way of uploading files on the web is using the content-type `multipart/form-data`, which is slightly different from JSON. If you have a model that should be able to support file uploads, you can configure the model to encode it's `JSONDictionary` into `multipart/form-data`.

The following example illustrates a `UserAvatar` model:

```swift
import RealmSwift
import ApiModel
import UIKit

class UserAvatar: Object, ApiModel, ApiConfigurable {
  dynamic var userId = ApiId()
  dynamic var url = String() // generated on the server

  var imageData: NSData?

  class func apiConfig(config: ApiConfig) -> ApiConfig {
    // ApiRequest.FormDataEncoding is where the magic happens
    // It tells ApiModel to encode everything with `multipart/form-data`
    config.encoding = ApiRequest.FormDataEncoding
    return config
  }

  // Important because the `imageData` property cannot be represented by Realm
  override class func ignoredProperties() -> [String] {
    return ["imageData"]
  }

  override class func primaryKey() -> String {
    return "userId"
  }

  class func apiNamespace() -> String {
    return "user_avatar"
  }

  class func apiRoutes() -> ApiRoutes {
    return ApiRoutes.resource("/user/avatar.json")
  }

  class func fromJSONMapping() -> JSONMapping {
    return [
      "userId": ApiIdTransform(),
      "url": StringTransform()
    ]
  }

  func JSONDictionary() -> [String:AnyObject] {
    return [
      "image": FileUpload(fileName: "avatar.jpg", mimeType: "image/jpg", data: imageData!)
    ]
  }    
}

func upload() {
  let image = UIImage(named: "me.jpg")!

  let userAvatar = UserAvatar()
  userAvatar.userId = "1"
  userAvatar.imageData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(image, 1)!

  Api(model: userAvatar).save { form in
    if form.hasErrors {
      print("Could not upload file: " + form.errorMessages.joinWithSeparator("\n"))
    } else {
      print("File uploaded! URL: \(userAvatar.url)")
    }
  }
}
```

### FileUpload

You can upload any file this way, not only images. Any NSData can be uploaded. The default mime type for uploaded files is `application/octet-stream`. If you need to configure this there is a special object you need to construct called `FileUpload`.

The constructor is illustrated above, and takes the file name the server receives, mimetype of the file, and the data.

```swift
FileUpload(fileName: "document.pdf", mimeType: "application/pdf", data: documentData)
```

This should be put in the `JSONDictionary` dictionary. ApiModel will detect it and encode it accordingly.
